# Razor-Express Views

Most likely you are know that the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) simplest web server built with [Express library](https://expressjs.com/) can work without any template engine. Express library can just serve static files in response the in response to a browser request. It can be any staic file including a file with HTML markup (which is essentially a regular text file). Although this method is still quite often used for simple small websites, it contains a number of disadvantages and is not suitable for more complex websites.

The main disadvantage is that your HTML file stores not only the structure of the document but also its data. When the data is mixed with HTML code you can't easily edit the data if you are not familiar with HTML. And when you need to edit HTML you have to wade through tons of text that have nothing to do with HTML itself. This is where the idea of separating code and data comes in. With this idea of separation, such terms as *"data"* and *"view"* are usually involved. Also, there are another two terms like *"model"* and *"model view"* which mean the same things and typically used in the context of MVC pattern.
