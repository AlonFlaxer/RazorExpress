## Views and View Template Engine
Most likely you know that the simplest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) web server built with [Express library](https://expressjs.com/) can work without any template engine. Express library can just [serve static files](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html) in response to a browser request. It can be any staic file including a file with HTML markup (which is essentially a regular text file). Although this method is still quite often used for simple small websites, it contains a number of disadvantages and is not suitable for more complex websites.

The main disadvantage is that your HTML file stores not only the structure of the document but also some data. When the data is mixed with HTML code you can't easily edit the data if you are not familiar with HTML and if you need to edit HTML you have to wade through tons of text that have nothing to do with HTML itself. This is where the idea of separating *markup* and *data* comes in. 

With this idea of separation, such terms as *"data"* and *"view"* are usually involved. Also, there are another two terms like *"Model-View"* or just *"Model"* which quite often mean the same thing and typically used in the context of [MVC pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview).

So, when the data is stored separately you need some mechanism that can correctly place it in HTML markup. To do this the HTML file must contain special fields or placeholders that have to be replaced with the appropriate data chunks. This file is usually called a *"view template"*, *"template"*, or just a *"view"*. And the mechanism which looks for the placeholders and fill them out with data chunks is usually called  *"View Template Engine"*. Different engines [have their differences](https://github.com/DevelAx/RazorExpress/blob/master/README.md#a-brief-comparison-of-syntax-of-nodejs-template-engines) but the basic idea is the same. 

Razor-Express engine is one of [many](https://github.com/expressjs/express/wiki#template-engines) working with Express. Razor-Express uses [Razor-like syntax](https://github.com/DevelAx/RazorExpress/blob/master/docs/syntax.md) based on the [ASP.NET MVC Razor concept](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor) which allows you to template views by mixing HTML markup with real server-side JavaScript code.

## Rendering layout system
When you have a *NodeJS Express web app* set up ([Express web-server example](https://github.com/DevelAx/RazorExpress/blob/master/README.md#express-web-server-example)) and run the *Express framework* starts to use the *Razor-Express engine* as a service to read *view template* files and process them into HTML. This process includes the following steps:

1. Express app receives a request from the browser.
2. The Express application analyzes the request URL and finds an appropriate route which determines a file to return in response to the browser request. 
3. Express makes sure that the file actually exists and then transfers control to the Razor-Express engine. Also Express may pass some *data (or model)* as a parameter to the engine to render it with the *view template* file content.
4. Razor-Express reads the *view template* file, runs server-side JavaScript incorporated in it, replaces placeholders with data from *model*, and finally renders HTML which is then returned back to Express.
5. Having control back the Express library sends that HTML to the browser.

It is a quite simplified description of the request handling to understand the role of the Razor-Express engine in this process. Now let's take a closer look at what happens in the Razor-Express engine while processing a *view template* and *data model*.

### Processing a view
When Razor-Express gets control, it also gets the full filename of a *view template* file and *data model* both passed as parameters. The *data model* is optional though. If the *template* is successfully processed the engine returns HTML. If a failure occurs while reading, parsing, or rendering the file RAZ returns an error. In any case at this point, its work is done.  

After the file is found and read, the engine tries to find all [starting view files](#starting-views-_viewstartraz) named *"_viewStart.raz"* following the [partial views standard search algorithm logic](#partial-view-search-algorithm). If they are found they are added to the current file from its beginning in the order the search sequence goes (each next found is added to the very beginning of the current file and so on).

When this process is finished the parser starts analyzing that assembled template (if no *"_viewStart.raz"* files are found it contains only the main view template). 

> It's worth noting that the *parser doesn't try to fully analyze the validity of HTML* in a template. For example, it is not much concerned about mistakes in the attributes of HTML tags. *Neither it checks the correctness of JavaScript syntax*, except for the base constructs. It only checks the integrity of the HTML tags tree and extracts snippets of server-side JavaScript code to perform in the next step. 

After parsing is done the execution process begins. At this point, the template placeholders are substituted with the appropriate values from the *data model* and all the server-side JavaScript code found in this template is executed. In this process, theÂ references to other view templates could be found. If so, each referenced template file is read and processed the same way as the main view (with which the engine has started) with the exception that the *"_viewStart.raz"* files are not considered anymore. Each referenced template file is processed separately from the main one and from the others. This means that if you declare a variable in one template it won't be available in any referenced template because each processed file is run in its own scope (and in its own moment). If you need to share some data between those views it is possible to do via `Model` and `ViewData` objects as will be discussed later. However, the *data model* (represented by the `Model` object within a view) is the same for all of them by default (unless it's explicitly set otherwise).

There are two types of view templates, which can be explicitly referenced from the rendering page template:
* [Layout](#layouts)
* [Partial view](#partial-views)

and one type of view that is referenced implicitly from any page view:
* [Starting view](#starting-views-_viewstartraz)

#### The views processing order

*The order in which views are processed is also important to remember* in case you decide to change some data in the model, for example, in one view and then use it in another. The **main template** with all the start views are processed first, as you already know. Then the **layout** (of that view) is processed. And only then all **partial views** are processed in the order they are referenced. 
Actually, it is not different from *ASP.NET MVC Razor*.

### Layouts
Layout is a common markup for a group of site pages that have some common elements, such as header, footer, menu, as well as other structures such as scripts, stylesheets, etc. Using layouts helps to reduce duplicate code in views. From the *Razor-Express engine* point of view, a layout is just a normal view template with the only difference being that the layout defines a top level template for other views. Using the layout is optional. Apps can define more than one layout, with different views specifying different layouts. A layout can have a reference to another layout and so forth which means that layouts can be nested (see an example [here](https://github.com/DevelAx/RazorExpressFullExample)). Layouts can have references to partial views as well.

Conventionally the default layout is named *"_layout.raz"*. To specify a layout for a view an `Html.layout` property must be set in that view:
```HTML+Razor
@{
    Html.layout = "_layout";
}
```
You can use either a partial name like in the example above or a full path:
```HTML+Razor
@{
    Html.layout = "/admin/_layout";
}
```
The layout file extension is optional in both cases. When a partial name is provided, the Razor-Express view engine searches for the layout file using its standard for [partial views discovery process](#partial-view-search-algorithm).

Each layout is supposed to call `@Html.body()` within itself where the contents of the current view have to be rendered. (As you remember, the page template is processed before the layout template, so this call renderers an already compiled page template.) 

#### Access data from a layout
A layout has access to the current view `Model` object. It is passed implicitly and there is no way to pass any other object. One possible way to transfer some data to the layout other than the view `Model` is to use the `ViewData` object. 

### Partial views
The term *"partial view"* clearly implies that HTML received as a result of processing a partial view template will become a part of another view which references it. Partial view can reference other partial views, but it _can't reference a layout_.

Partial views are supposed to be a means to reuse the same code snippets from different views thus avoiding duplication. Also there is another advantage where large, complex markup file can be split into sereveral logical pieces and each one can be isolated within a partial view for easier perception and work with them.

By convention, partial view file names begin with an underscore (`_`). It's not strictly required, although it helps to visually differentiate them from page views.

To reference a partial view from any view use the `Html.partial` method:
```HTML+Razor
@Html.partial("_partial")
```
This method initiates [search](#partial-view-search-algorithm) the `_partial.raz` view file, compiling it into HTML, and then rendering this HTML in the parent view where this method is placed.

> :warning: It's worth emphasizing once again that *only a page template is processed together with starting template* as one whole template (they are joined before being parsed and executed). All other templates are parsed and executed separately, and only then included in each other in the form of ready-made HTML.

#### Access data from partial views
The `Html.partial` method also can take a second parameter through which you can pass the `Model`. 
```HTML+Razor
@Html.partial("_partial", { text: "This is an explicit model passing to the partial view." })
```
If this argument is omitted the `Model` of the parent view is passed by default implicitly. Also partial views have access to the `ViewData` object as every view template does.

### Partial view search algorithm

* If a partial view is specified *only by a file name* with or without an extension (as in the [Partial views section](#partial-views) example above) then the search begins with the directory in which the view that initiates the search is located. If the partial view is not found in the current directory the search goes on up the directory tree until it reaches the root views folder specified in the [Express app](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html) (which is set as `app.set('views', './views')` by default). If the file is still not found an error is returned.
* In the case where the *full path relative to the root views directory* is specified the file will be searched only in this directory. Never include the views rootÂ folder name in the full path!
* To make the search take place *only in the current directory*, use relative to the current directory path format `'./_partialView'`.

Different partial views with the same file name are allowed when the partial views are in different folders.

Partial views can be chained â a partial view can call another partial view and so on(be careful not to create circular references).

### Starting views (`_viewStart.raz`)
Starting views named *"_viewStart.raz"* are intended to contain code that needs to run before the code of the main view of the page is executed (not before layouts or partial views). Starting views are hierarchical -  if a `_viewStart.raz` file is defined in the current view folder, it will be run after the one defined in the root views folder (if any).

Usually, the `_viewStart.raz` file is used to specify a [layout](#layouts) for a group of views (located in a specific folder or several folders). For example, you can define a `_viewStart.raz` file with the next code:
```HTML+Razor
@{
    Html.layout = "_layout";
}
```
in a folder with other views instead of adding this code in the beginning of each of these views.
